Hello, mr adventurer Gadiel Smith

Here are some of my ideas to get away from it all, first of them is creating a coccoon and only coming out
once you've turned into a beautiful butterfly. Second would be getting into the matrix or the megaverse
and third I guess would be just you know reading, watching netflix, drawing, playing games, serving the 
bird overloard that sorta stuff.
